Revision history for Leyland

0.001007  2011-07-04 22:50:33 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Bugfix: response object now does not get text/html content
	  type on initialization as it is not necessarily true
	- Bugfix: when running a leyland app the initial summary table prints
	  route regexes as-is since perl 5.14 changes the way regex variables
	  are printed stringwise
	- When an exception is thrown and app is running on the deployment
	  environment, if client accepts html and exception was not defined
	  an html template - leyland lets Plack's StackTrace middleware
	  handle the exception and print a nice stack trace

0.001006  2011-06-24 23:30:19 Asia/Jerusalem
	- When forwarding internally (with $c->forward), requests to pass
	  requests are now honored
	- Forcing MooseX::ClassAttribute version 0.24 as previous versions
	  seem to cause problems

	- Fixed bug with passing requests (using $c->pass)
	- When on the development environment, Leyland let's exceptions
	  that do not define MIME templates be handled by Plack's nice
	  stacktrace middleware (which is automatically enabled on the
	  development environment)

0.001003  2011-04-22 22:29:11 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Developers can now create routes that return any media type
